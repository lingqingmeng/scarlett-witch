As the creator of [@mandarinwanda](ig.me/mandarinwanda), I built a personal brand around Mandarin language learning and cultural content, growing the account to 36K followers organically in 3 years. Through consistent posting, community engagement, and creative storytelling, I established @mandarinwanda as a trusted resource for learners worldwide.

**Key Achievements:**
Reached an average of 250K monthly reach and 400K+ monthly views consistently over 3 years.
Maintained a strong 4.2% average engagement rate through interactive content and reels.
Partnered with language learning platforms for sponsored collaborations and brand campaigns.
Designed all original graphics, reels, and learning materials independently.
Founded and managed an Etsy e-commerce store selling digital language-learning resources
